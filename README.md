Tutorials to make your Wallpaper Engine look like game systems

In this thread, you can find out how to use Wallpaper Engine to create 
different wallpapers that mimmick menus from game systems, and have it
work properly, where clicking on icons will open up folders or games!

This was inspired by [Lillykyu's Wii Menu wallpaper](https://vxtwitter.com/lillykyu778/status/1944475020811489639).
I'll explain how to make that here too, with assets provided by them.

It should be noted that this guide requires some experience in
image editing for making your own icons or banners, and you may
need some experience in Javascript, as Wallpaper Engine's main
coding language, Scenescript, is based on it. I'll try my best
to explain everything here, but just keep that in mind
before getting into this.
